                <p>Hi, my name is Ejex Xeffer. All my story was connected with a lot of problems and solutions. I try to become an inventor, because my head hurts from the ideas that I want to bring to life. I think my words sound strange, but invention is what I believe. </p>
                <p>I'm 24 years old, and at the moment I'm engaged in programming. So I draw and create my first projects in iron. Basically here in a blog I write my thoughts and notes about programming and designing. Designing everything to what hands will get.</p>
                <p>In the future, I plan to start a video blog, once a month doing the publication.</p>
				<p>In the meantime, you can observe the evolution of this blog and my evolution as well. I hope the articles in this blog will be useful to you or at least funny. </p>
